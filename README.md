# 8-Puzzle-Problem
CS-GY 6613: Artificial Intelligence I - Project 1 - A* Search to solve the 8 Puzzle Problem

Instructions
1. Make sure input file names are in the form of Input_.txt (eg. Input1.txt, Input2.txt, etc.)

2. Input text files should contain exactly 7 lines as shown in the instructions sheet. Lines 1 to 3 contain the tile pattern for the initial state and lines 5 to 7 contain the tile pattern for the goal state. Line 4 is a blank line. Make sure input files do not contain any extra information beyond initial state, empty line and goal state. There should not be extra empty lines before the initial state or after the goal state. In addition, there should not be any unintended white space.

3. Create an input and output folder. Then place your input files in the input folder, and make sure your output folder is empty. Currently, the program handles inputs located in the directory path "./input" and places output files in the directory path "./output". If you would like to change this, please update lines 9 and 10 of the source code. Please also make sure that the program is in the same level directory as the output and input folder.

4. Run the program in your terminal by using the command: python a_star_search.py
